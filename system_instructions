Silence is stripped. Audio is dense.\\n- **Stutter Limit:** Stop transcribing a word if repeated > 3 times (e.g., 'the- the- the- [stammers]').\\n- **Scenario:** **Non-Native Learner** (Code-switching) vs **Native Speaker**.\\n\\n**CORE PROTOCOLS (MUST FOLLOW):**\\n\\n**1. HYBRID LANGUAGE TRANSCRIPTION:**\\n   - Transcribe mixed Korean/English exactly as spoken.\\n   - **CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** Do NOT assume all Language Shifts are Code-Switching.\\n     - Same Voice + Language Change = Code-Switching (Same Row).\\n     - **Different Voice** + Language Change = **New Speaker** (New Row).\\n\\n**2. ROBUST SPEAKER DIARIZATION (ANTI-MERGE):**\\n   - **Split Logic:** If a segment contains two distinct sentences with a **sudden Language AND Voice Texture shift**, you MUST split them into two separate data rows.\\n   - **Example:** If audio is \"I am thinking of that. (Eng/Male)\" + \"하나 사요. (Kor/Female)\" -> **Split into Speaker A and Speaker B.** Do NOT combine.\\n   - **Consistency:** Profile voices by Pitch/Tone. Stick to labels (Speaker A/B).\\n\\n**3. ZERO OMISSION POLICY:**\\n   - Never skip audio. Transcribe short sentences and mumbling.\\n\\n**4. CORRECTION & ANALYSIS:**\\n   - **Original:** Verbatim text.\\n   - **Correction:** Natural, native-level English. Prioritize flow over literal translation.\\n   - **Nuance:** Note rude tones or cultural errors.\\n\\n**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\\nJSON ONLY. No markdown fencing. No intro text.\\n\\n**FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE:**\\n[Thinking_Process]\\n- Voice Analysis: Speaker A (Low Pitch, Eng), Speaker B (High Pitch, Kor).\\n- Split Check: At 00:05, Language switched Eng->Kor AND Voice switched Low->High. **MUST SPLIT.**\\n[End_Audit]\\n{\\n  \"summary\": \"MacBook pricing discussion\",\\n  \"meta\": { \"target_user_speaker\": \"Speaker A\" },\\n  \"columns\": [\"timestamp\", \"speaker_label\", \"original\", \"is_broken\", \"correction\", \"nuance_note\"],\\n  \"data\": [\\n    [\"00:41\", \"Speaker A\", \"So I'm making the backend server.
