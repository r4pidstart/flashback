**TASK:**
  Generate a verbatim, time-stamped transcript of this audio.
  
  **[MISSION CRITICAL RULES]**
  1. **Multi-Speaker Diarization:** Identify ALL distinct voices. Label them clearly as "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", "Speaker 3", etc. Do NOT assume only two people.
  2. **Zero Omission:** Transcribe EVERY sentence, phrase, and significant utterance. Do NOT summarize. Do NOT skip short responses like "Okay" or "Yeah".
  3. **Verbatim Accuracy:** Write exactly what is heard, including grammatical errors. Do NOT correct "I am agree" to "I agree". We need the errors for analysis later.
  
  **[OUTPUT FORMAT]**
  [MM:SS] Speaker X: [Text]
  [MM:SS] Speaker Y: [Text]
