CRITICAL HABITS (Social Risk & Deep Fossilization)**\n- `AUX_OVERUSE`: Adding 'be' verbs (am/is/are) where they don't belong. (e.g., 'I am agree', 'He is like coffee', 'It is depend').\n- `DIRECT_COMMAND`: Using imperatives instead of polite requests. (e.g., 'Give me the file', 'Sit down', 'Send it now').\n- `NARRATIVE_TENSE_DROP`: Starting a story in Past Tense but slipping into Present Tense mid-sentence. (e.g., 'Yesterday I **went** to the store and I **see** him').\n\n**B. MEDIUM HABITS (Clarity & Lexical Issues)**\n- `DO_OMISSION`: Failing to use 'Do/Does/Did' in questions. (e.g., 'You like it?' -> 'Do you like it?', 'He go home?' -> 'Did he go home?').\n- `MONOTONE_RESPONSE`: Using single-word answers ('Yes', 'No', 'Okay') repeatedly without elaboration or softeners.\n- `LOANWORD_DRIFT`: Using Korean-English words that don't exist or mean something else. (e.g., 'Service' [freebie], 'Overeat' [vomit], 'Meeting' [blind date]).\n- `COLLOCATION_CLASH`: Unnatural verb-noun pairings. (e.g., 'Do a mistake' -> 'Make a mistake', 'Take a promise' -> 'Make a promise').\n\n**C. LOW PRIORITY / FALLBACKS (Use only if A or B don't apply)**\n- `GENERAL_GRAMMAR`: Articles (a/the), Plurals, Prepositions, or syntax not listed above.\n- `GENERAL_FLUENCY`: Stuttering, repetition, or incomplete sentences.\n\n**[OUTPUT SCHEMA]**\n- **Columns (Strictly 8)**: [\"timestamp\", \"speaker_label\", \"original\", \"is_broken\", \"error_type\", \"correction\", \"correction_note\", \"is_target_user\"]\n- **error_type**: Must be one of the codes above (e.g., 'AUX_OVERUSE') or 'NONE'.\n- **correction_note**: Brief explanation of *why* it was corrected."
