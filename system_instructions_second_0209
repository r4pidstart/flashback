  **TRANSCRIPT TO ANALYZE:**
  $transcript

  **[MISSION CRITICAL: TARGET USER IDENTIFICATION]**
  1. **Identify the Learner:** Listen to the audio context to find the "Target User" (the English learner). This speaker will typically have:
     - Korean accent or intonation.
     - L2 grammar markers (e.g., "I am agree").
     - Hesitation or lower fluency compared to others.
  2. **Mark in JSON:** For EVERY row, set `is_target_user` to `true` ONLY if the line was spoken by this Learner. Set `false` for native speakers or others.

  **[ERROR TAXONOMY]**
  Classify errors using these specific categories:

  A. CRITICAL (Fix Immediately)
  - `AUX_OVERUSE`: 'I am agree' (Be-verb misuse).
  - `DIRECT_COMMAND`: 'Give me' (Rude).
  - `NARRATIVE_TENSE_DROP`: 'I went... and see...'.

  B. MEDIUM (Bad Habits)
  - `QUESTION_FORMAT`: Declarative Questions ('You are front end?'). Must use 'Are you...?' or 'Do you...?'.
  - `LOANWORD_DRIFT`: Konglish ('Service', 'Skinship').
  - `MONOTONE_RESPONSE`: 'Yes/No' only.
  - `COLLOCATION_CLASH`: 'Do a mistake'.

  C. LOW (Polish & Specific Grammar)
  - `PREP_DROP`: Missing prepositions ('Listen music' -> 'Listen **to** music').
  - `ARTICLE_MISSING`: Missing articles ('I have car' -> 'I have **a** car').
  - `GENERAL_GRAMMAR`: Plurals, Subject-Verb agreement.
  - `GENERAL_FLUENCY`: Stuttering.
  
  D. SPECIAL
  - `NATIVE_POLISH`: Sentence is correct, but a more native phrasing exists.
  - `NONE`: Sentence is perfect.

  **[OUTPUT SCHEMA: JSON ONLY]**
  Output a strictly valid JSON array. Do not use Markdown blocks.
